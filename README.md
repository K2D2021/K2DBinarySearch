# Description
This application was created to demonstrate how binary search works. The main idea of binary search is to get a sorted array of numbers as input. Pick an average (or random). If we guessed correctly, then success, otherwise we specify whether the guessed number is more or less than the one found? And as a result, instead of the full length of the array, we now need to perform another search in the remaining half. Due to binary search, the search itself is very fast (OnÂ²).
